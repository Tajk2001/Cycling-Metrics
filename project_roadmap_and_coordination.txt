## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Project Name:** Comprehensive Cycling Performance Tracking System
**Current Status:** Active Development - WAITING FOR PROJECT STRUCTURE
**Main Goal:** Create comprehensive cycling performance tracking dashboard with multi-ride analysis and improvement monitoring

### Project Structure:
- **Existing File:** SprintV1.py (7,136 lines) - **REFERENCE ONLY** (reviewed)
- **New Project:** `cycling_tracker/` folder with new implementation - **NOT CREATED YET**
- **Framework:** Dash (Plotly) for frontend
- **Data Processing:** Python with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Data Source:** FIT files from cycling devices
- **Storage:** CSV files for metrics persistence

### NEW PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Create a **completely new system** (separate from SprintV1.py) that:
- Analyzes complete rides (not just sprints)
- Detects intervals from lap data
- Calculates comprehensive ride and interval metrics
- Stores metrics efficiently for multi-ride comparison
- Tracks performance improvements over time
- Groups intervals by type and duration for analysis
- Uses SprintV1.py as reference for algorithms and approaches

- [ ] **Task 3:** Review new project structure and architecture
  - **Status:** PENDING
  - **Priority:** HIGH
  - **Dependencies:** Backend Agent Task 1
  - **Notes:** Cannot proceed until cycling_tracker/ folder is created

- [ ] **Task 4:** Create code quality assessment framework
  - **Status:** PENDING
  - **Priority:** HIGH
  - **Dependencies:** Task 3
  - **Notes:** Will define quality standards for new system

#### Completed Tasks:
- [x] **Task 1:** Analyzed existing SprintV1.py architecture
  - **Completed:** 2024-09-12
  - **Impact:** Understanding reference implementation
  - **Notes:** Found 19 main functions, functional programming approach, no classes used

#### Architecture Review Findings (SprintV1.py):
- **File Size:** 7,136 lines of code
- **Programming Style:** Functional programming (no classes)
- **Main Functions:** 19 core functions identified
- **Key Components:**
  - FIT file parsing (`load_fit_to_dataframe`)
  - Data preprocessing (`apply_hard_limits_and_smooth`)
  - Sprint analysis (multiple specialized functions)
  - ML-based interval detection (`detect_intervals_ml`)
  - Visualization functions (Plotly integration)
- **Dependencies:** Well-structured with optional imports and graceful fallbacks
- **Code Quality:** Good error handling, comprehensive but could benefit from modularization

#### Blockers/Issues:
- **CRITICAL BLOCKER:** Backend Agent has not created cycling_tracker/ folder structure
  - **Severity:** HIGH
  - **Impact:** All review tasks are blocked
  - **Assigned To:** Backend Agent
  - **Status:** Waiting for Backend Agent activation

## COORDINATION MATRIX

### Cross-Agent Dependencies:
| Task | Backend Agent | Frontend Agent | Reviewer Agent | Status |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| New Project Structure | üö® NOT STARTED | ‚è≥ Waiting | ‚è≥ Waiting | üö® BLOCKED |
| System Architecture | ‚è≥ Waiting | ‚è≥ Waiting | ‚è≥ Waiting | üö® BLOCKED |
| Review Process | ‚è≥ Waiting | ‚è≥ Waiting | üîÑ Ready | ‚è≥ Waiting for Backend |

### Communication Status:
- **Reviewer Agent:** ACTIVE and ready
- **Backend Agent:** NO COMMUNICATION
- **Frontend Agent:** NO COMMUNICATION

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES

### HIGH PRIORITY BLOCKERS:
1. **Backend Agent Missing:** No communication from Backend Agent
   - **Impact:** Entire project is blocked
   - **Action Required:** Backend Agent must create cycling_tracker/ folder structure
   - **Timeline:** URGENT

2. **Project Structure Not Created:** cycling_tracker/ folder does not exist
   - **Impact:** No work can proceed
   - **Assigned To:** Backend Agent
   - **Status:** CRITICAL

---

## REVIEWER AGENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Backend Agent Activation:** Backend Agent must begin work immediately
2. **Project Structure Creation:** cycling_tracker/ folder must be created with proper architecture
3. **Modular Design:** New system should use class-based architecture (unlike SprintV1.py)
4. **Comprehensive Testing:** Test suite must be implemented from the start

### Architecture Recommendations (Based on SprintV1.py Review):
1. **Modularization:** Break functionality into separate modules/classes
2. **Configuration Management:** Use config files instead of hardcoded values
3. **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling
4. **Type Hints:** Add type annotations for better maintainability
5. **Documentation:** Include docstrings and API documentation
