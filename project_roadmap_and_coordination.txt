## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Project Name:** Comprehensive Cycling Performance Tracking System
**Current Status:** Active Development - NEW PROJECT CREATION
**Main Goal:** Create comprehensive cycling performance tracking dashboard with multi-ride analysis and improvement monitoring

### Project Structure:
- **Existing File:** SprintV1.py (6,264 lines) - **UNCHANGED** (reference only)
- **New Project:** `cycling_tracker/` folder with new implementation
- **Framework:** Dash (Plotly) for frontend
- **Data Processing:** Python with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Data Source:** FIT files from cycling devices
- **Storage:** CSV files for metrics persistence

### NEW PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Create a **completely new system** (separate from SprintV1.py) that:
- Analyzes complete rides (not just sprints)
- Detects intervals from lap data
- Calculates comprehensive ride and interval metrics
- Stores metrics efficiently for multi-ride comparison
- Tracks performance improvements over time
- Groups intervals by type and duration for analysis
- Uses SprintV1.py as reference for algorithms and approaches
